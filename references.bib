There is instead a Prisoners' Dilemma-type ``syndrome of anarchy'' under the canals, in which farmers lack the confidence that if they refrain from taking water out of turn they will get water on time, and officials lack the confidence that if they work conscientiously to deliver the water on time, farmers will refrain from rule-breaking. In East Asia this syndrome of irrigation anarchy scarcely exists. The reasons for the difference are partly to do with agro-climatic conditions. But they are also related to policy-relevant variables of physical design and organizational arrangements. Within the constraints of agro-climatic conditions, features of East Asian design and organization might usefully be transferred to Indian conditions; including break-point reservoirs, irrigation scheduling and monitoring, separation of construction organization from operations and maintenance organization, and catchment-based operating agencies with their own revenue base.},

  abstract = {In dealing with the (necessary) oversimplifications, it can be important to distinguish models, toys and leading cases (the latter are emphasized here). Analyzing data involves both stochastic and functional models. We should do whatever we can to avoid having to trust the correctness of a single stochastic model. Narrow specifications are usually toys. Very broad specifications (e.g., nonparametric or distribution-free specifications) are usually wasteful and, more importantly, often keep us from seeking stringency. Robustness--seeking good performance over a reasonably wide range of stochastic alternatives--is the middle way. Two ways of formulating "a reasonably wide range"--an asymptotic approach and a few-specified leading case approach-have so far led to similar choices. If and when they disagree, the latter is to be preferred.A particular estimator of location for a particular specification is classically assessed in such terms as mean square error, variance and pseudovariance, which prove to be mutually supporting. Configurations are equivalence classes of samples, equivalent under a linear transformation. Requiring equivariance within each configuration is an effective way of ruling out possible effects of preconceptions. Specifications can be dangerously unrealistic by not being bland.We can arrange to use a single set of samples as sets of samples from different distributions by using different sets of weights. Such polysampling can be extended to configurations. Averaging over samples can often usefully begin by going first to configurations by using numerical integration. The second stage ordinarily involves experimental sampling.Pitman gave the form of the minimum variance equivariant estimate 46 years ago (Biometrika, 30 (1939), pp. 391--421). For the simpler problems we can now afford to do the necessary numerical integrations. Pitman's results can be extended to the minimization of variance for two (or more) specifications, when the answer becomes a parametric family of estimates, which can be found in terms of chosen linear combinations of the two (or more) variances.Many of us realize that minimizing exactly for one criterion often leads to unsatisfactory performance for other criteria. Minimizing exactly for two criteria is not as dangerous, but has similar difficulties. This is illustrated, qualitatively, for location with \$n = 20\$. The bioptimal estimator, while extremely valuable in making clear whan can and cannot be done, is probably not the estimator of final practical choice for location. George Easton has been led by configural polysampling ideas to a different approach, which seems most promising (unpublished Ph.D. thesis, Princeton Univ., 1985).The logical flow of the discussion of the location problem includes important elements of insight and factual knowledge, both before and after the formal optimization. Those who design consumer products, be they milk bottles or estimators, cannot be content with the results of formal optimization. Techniques of double (and multiple) optimization deserve more attention than SIAM members seem to have given them.},

The balance of moral and pragmatic considerations also varies with the nature of the exercise. There are other differences, for example, whether the procedures permit the use of discretion in interpreting individual utilities or are mechanical. The nature of the exercise affects the appropriate specification of the social choice format. This relates to distinctions among structures such as social welfare functions, social decision functions, social choice functions or functional collective choice rules, or social welfare functional. It also affects the appropriateness of particular axioms within a given structure, for example, whether the social welfare function satisfies the independence condition or what types of interpersonal comparability if any is used.

Outcomes are mutual-max when each person maximizes the other's material payoffs, and mutual-min when each person minimizes the other's payoffs. It is shown that every mutual-max or mutual-min Nash equilibrium is a fairness equilibrium. If payoffs are small, fairness equilibria are roughly the set of mutual-max and mutual-min outcomes; if payoffs are large, fairness equilibria are roughly the set of Nash equilibria. Several economic examples are considered, and possible welfare implications of fairness are explored.},

Static and mechanistic analysis, however, is not adequate to understand the changing world in which we live. In order to adequately address the most pressing social and environmental challenges looming ahead, we need to develop analytical tools for analyzing dynamic situations \textendash{} particularly institutional change. In this paper, we develop an analytical tool to study institutional change, more specifically, the evolution of rules and norms. We believe that in order for such an analytical tool to be useful to develop a general theory of institutional change, it needs to enable the analyst to concisely record the processes of change in multiple specific settings so that lessons from such settings can eventually be integrated into a more general predictive theory of change.},

  abstract = {In society, power is often transferred to another person or group. A previous work studied the evolution of cooperation among robot players through a coalition formation game with a non-cooperative procedure of acceptance of an agency of another player. Motivated by this previous work, we conduct a laboratory experiment on finitely repeated three-person coalition formation games. Human players with different strength according to the coalition payoffs can accept a transfer of power to another player, the agent, who then distributes the coalition payoffs. We find that the agencies method for coalition formation is quite successful in promoting efficiency. However, the agent faces a tension between short-term incentives of not equally distributing the coalition payoff and the long-term concern to keep cooperation going. In a given round, the strong player in our experiment often resolves this tension approximately in line with the Shapley value and the nucleolus. Yet aggregated over all rounds, the payoff differences between players are rather small, and the equal division of payoffs predicts about 80\% of all groups best. One reason is that the voting procedure appears to induce a balance of power, independent of the individual player's strength: Selfish subjects tend to be voted out of their agency and are further disciplined by reciprocal behaviors.},

This measure, which is called the redundancy, appears in two versions, one microcanonical (or combinatorial) and the other canonical (or parametrical). The microcanomical redundancy is obtained by dividing minus the logarithm of the critical level by the Boltzmann entropy of the experiment and the canonical redundancy by dividing minus the logarithm of the likelihood ratio by the Gibbsian entropy. An approximation theorem shows that the former may be approximated asymptotically by the latter. The problem of calibrating the redundancy scale is discussed in connection with a series of examples, and, finally, certain considerations concerning the size of a statistical experiment are given which are based on the redundancy rather than the power function.},

  abstract = {Improving irrigation systems in Asian countries has been a high priority for the allocation of international aid. Substantial funds have been allocated to adopt the ``best practices'' of hiring external water engineers to construct modern systems to replace those that farmers built. These expensive investments have infrequently led to long-term improvement in the operation of irrigation systems in Asia. In this article, we examine the process and impact of an innovative irrigation assistance project that was initially undertaken in Nepal in the mid-1980s. We analyze data obtained over three time periods related to changes in system structure and performance over time. We trace the unfolding patterns of improved engineering infrastructure across time depending on the way it interacts with other factors to affect long-term irrigation performance. We examine some of the key variables that are likely to affect the diverse and complex patterns of change. We also undertake analysis of the configural impact of core variables using Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). We find that the initial and later investments in system infrastructure are only one factor that helps to generate short-term improvement. Unless farmers encourage local entrepreneurs and organize themselves, create their own rules or use sanctions, and augment their rules through collective action, infrastructure investment alone is not sufficient to achieve sustainable higher performance.},

The so-called "people's war" was launched in 1996 by the Communist Party of Nepal to overthrow the political establishment, including the monarchy. Tactics have included killing members of rival parties as well as attacks on police stations, banks, and power installations. The indiscriminate nature of the government's military response has been widely criticized. In 2001, Nepal's political situation came to the attention of Western news media with the murders of members of the royal family. This book provides historical, social, and political background on the movement and related events in this ongoing struggle. The contributors examine the war's origins and antecedents, provide ethnographic accounts from rural and urban perspectives, and draw comparisons with other Maoist movements elsewhere in the world. Includes full text of key documents by the rebels and government.},

Taking that enthusiasm as its starting point, Governing Knowledge Commons argues that policymaking should be based on evidence and a deeper understanding of what makes commons institutions work. It offers a systematic way to study knowledge commons, borrowing and building on Elinor Ostrom's Nobel Prize-winning research on natural resource commons. It proposes a framework for studying knowledge commons that is adapted to the unique attributes of knowledge and information, describing the framework in detail and explaining how to put it into context both with respect to commons research and with respect to innovation and information policy. Eleven detailed case studies apply and discuss the framework exploring knowledge commons across a wide variety of scientific and cultural domains.},

This level locates the given data set within the spectrum of other data sets derived from the given one by an appropriate class of transformations. If the null hypothesis being tested holds, the derived data sets should be equivalent to the original one. Thus, a small reported significance level indicates an unusual data set. This development parallels that of randomization tests, but there is a crucial technical difference: our approach involves permuting observed residuals; the classical randomization approach involves permuting unobservable, or perhaps nonexistent, stochastic disturbance terms.},

On the one hand, it emphasizes the question of indeterminacy, i.e. situations in which the rational choice is not well defined. The paradoxes of backward induction find their place here, as do the existence and importance of genuine uncertainty (as distinct from risk). On the other hand, the article discusses the question whether preferences can be said to be rational. Examples include time preferences, attitudes to risk, regret and the 'taste for fairness'. The examples are chosen with a view to showing that rational choice theory is not a predictive theory, but essentially a hermeneutic one. As part of the enterprise of self-understanding, the construction of rationality is partly discovery and partly decision. There is no right answer to all questions.},

This within-country analysis complements existing cross-country studies on the same subject. Using a detailed dataset to track civil war casualties across space and over time, several patterns are documented. Conflict-related deaths are significantly higher in poorer districts and in geographical locations that favor insurgents, such as mountains and forests; a 10 percentage point increase in poverty is associated with 25\textemdash{}27 additional conflict-related deaths. This result is similar to that documented in cross-country studies. In addition, the relationship with poverty and geography is similar for deaths caused by the insurgents and deaths caused by the state. Furthermore, poorer districts are likely to be drawn into the insurgency earlier, consistent with the theory that a lower cost of recruiting rebels is an important factor in starting conflict. On the other hand, geographic factors are not significantly associated with such onset, suggesting that they instead contribute to the intensity of violence only after conflict has started. Finally, in contrast to some cross-country analyses, ethnic and caste polarization, land inequality, and political participation are not significantly associated with violence.},

Such tests are regarded as procedures for measuring the consistency of data with a null hypothesis by the calculation of a p-value (tail area). A distinction is drawn between several kinds of null hypothesis. The ways of deriving tests, namely via the so-called absolute test, via implicit consideration of alternatives and via explicit consideration of alternatives are reviewed. Some of the difficulties of multidimensional alternatives are outlined and the importance of the diagnostic ability of a test is stressed. Brief examples include tests of distributional form including multivariate normality. The effect of modifying statistical analysis in the light of the data is discussed, four main cases being distinguished. Then a number of more technical aspects of significance tests are outlined, including the role of two-sided tests, the role of the continuity correction, Bayesian tests and the use of tests in the comparison of alternative models. Finally the circumstances are reviewed under which significance tests can provide the main summary of a statistical analysis.},

These reveal themselves in a negotiational, or behavioristic, psychology of persuasion and coercion in bargaining transactions, command and obedience in managerial transactions, argument and pleading in rationing transactions. Transactions determine legal control, while the classical and hedonic economics was concerned with physical control. Legal control is future physical control. The three social relations implicit in translations are conflict, dependence and order. Social philosophies differ economically according to the kind of transactions which they place uppermost.},

It uses a unique multicountry dataset, created over the past 15 years by the International Forestry Resources and Institutions Research Program. Drawing on original enforcement and forest commons data from 9 countries, we find that higher levels of local enforcement have a strong and positive but complex relationship to the probability of forest regeneration. This relationship holds even when the influence of a number of other factors such as user group size, subsistence, and commercial importance of forests, size of forest, and collective action for forest improvement activities is taken into account. Although several of the above factors have a statistically significant relationship to changes in the condition of forest commons, differences in levels of local enforcement strongly moderate their link with forest commons outcomes. The research, using data from diverse political, social, and ecological contexts, shows both the importance of enforcement to forest commons and some of the limits of forest governance through commons arrangements.},

  abstract = {Almost all economic and public choice models assume that all people are exclusively pursuing their own material self-interests and do not care about "social" goals per se. Several (laboratory) experiments address the question of the general validity of this assumption. A consistent conclusion emerges that a significant number of people deviate from the assumption of selfish rational behaviour; this conclusion is robust with respect to the design of the experiments. Therefore, public choice comes with a price: the conclusions are based on the stylized stereotype of economic man, an assumption that is not fully satisfied. The purpose of this paper is to show how to incorporate otherregarding preferences into an otherwise traditional utility approach without losing predicting power or compromising the rationality assumption. On the contrary, since other-regarding preferences are based on observed behaviour, the predicting power increases; this is demonstrated at the end of this paper, where it is shown how other-regarding preferences can explain the existence and persistence of a welfare state and why people might act sustainably.},

Part I includes chapters surveying the key research methodologies employed in comparative politics (the comparative method; the use of history; the practice and status of case-study research; the contributions of field research) and assessing the possibility of constructing a science of comparative politics. Parts II to IV examine the foundations of political order: the origins of states and the extent to which they relate to war and to economic development; the sources of compliance or political obligation among citizens; democratic transitions, the role of civic culture; authoritarianism; revolutions; civil wars and contentious politics. Parts V and VI explore the mobilization, representation and coordination of political demands. Part V considers why parties emerge, the forms they take and the ways in which voters choose parties. It then includes chapters on collective action, social movements and political participation. Part VI opens up with essays on the mechanisms through which political demands are aggregated and coordinated. This sets the agenda to the systematic exploration of the workings and effects of particular institutions: electoral systems, federalism, legislative-executive relationships, the judiciary and bureaucracy. Finally, Part VII is organized around the burgeoning literature on macropolitical economy of the last two decades.},

We also provide an alternative estimator of the standard errors that is correct when the error structures show complications found in this type of model. Monte Carlo analysis shows that these ``panel-corrected standard errors'' perform well. The utility of our approach is demonstrated via a reanalysis of one ``social democratic corporatist'' model.},

We analyze the rule formation of a sample of irrigation systems based on the ADICO syntax (Crawford \& Ostrom, 1995; Ostrom, 2005). Farmer-managed irrigation systems generally are autonomous in devising their own rules based on local context considering the ideas, norms and beliefs shared within the community. Rule formation in agency-managed irrigation systems, however, is mostly done by external officials. Strong rule enforcement mechanisms were found in farmer-managed systems compared with agency-managed systems. Better rule enforcement created favorable conditions for collective action among the users and ensured better performance of the irrigation systems. Results imply that the formation of new rules should fully consider biophysical attributes as well as community beliefs and ideas.},

  abstract = {This article assesses the role of local institutions in managing irrigation water use. Fifty irrigation systems in each country were studied in Nepal and Thailand to compare the influence of local institutions on performance of irrigation systems amid changes in external policy and market pressures. Nepal's new irrigation policy after the re-instatement of multiparty democracy in 1990 emphasized participatory irrigation management transferring the management responsibility from state authorities to water users. The water user associations of traditional farmer-managed irrigation systems were formally recognized by requiring registration with related state authorities. In Thailand also government policies encouraged people's participation in irrigation management. Today water users are directly involved in management of even some large irrigation systems at the level of tertiary canals. Traditional communal irrigation systems in northern Thailand received support for system infrastructure improvement but have faced increased interference from government. In Thailand market development supported diversification in farming practices resulting in increased areas under high water-demanding commercial crops in the dry season. In contrast, the command areas of most irrigation systems in Nepal include cereal-based subsistence farming with only one-third having commercial farming. Cropping intensities are higher in Nepal than in Thailand reflecting, in part, differences in availability of land and management. In both countries local institutions play an important role in maintaining the performance of irrigation systems as external drivers and local contexts change. Local institutions have provided alternative options for irrigation water use by mediating external pressures.},

  volume = {1 A},
  isbn = {1574-0684},
  abstract = {This paper develops the empirical and theoretical case that differences in economic institutions are the fundamental cause of differences in economic development. We first document the empirical importance of institutions by focusing on two ``quasi-natural experiments'' in history, the division of Korea into two parts with very different economic institutions and the colonization of much of the world by European powers starting in the fifteenth century. We then develop the basic outline of a framework for thinking about why economic institutions differ across countries. Economic institutions determine the incentives of and the constraints on economic actors, and shape economic outcomes. As such, they are social decisions, chosen for their consequences. Because different groups and individuals typically benefit from different economic institutions, there is generally a conflict over these social choices, ultimately resolved in favor of groups with greater political power. The distribution of political power in society is in turn determined by political institutions and the distribution of resources. Political institutions allocate de jure political power, while groups with greater economic might typically possess greater de facto political power. We therefore view the appropriate theoretical framework as a dynamic one with political institutions and the distribution of resources as the state variables. These variables themselves change over time because prevailing economic institutions affect the distribution of resources, and because groups with de facto political power today strive to change political institutions in order to increase their de jure political power in the future. Economic institutions encouraging economic growth emerge when political institutions allocate power to groups with interests in broad-based property rights enforcement, when they create effective constraints on power-holders, and when there are relatively few rents to be captured by power-holders. We illustrate the assumptions, the workings and the implications of this framework using a number of historical examples.},
